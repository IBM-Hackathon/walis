# Walis - Watson Alzheimer Support
Walis is a roboter to support Alzheimer patients in their daily life. It will reminds & check the patient about the activities over the day like meals, medication (order, food intolerance) and other events like family visits. It includes a smartphone app, e.g for absence family members to monitor this regular schedule and warn in case of irregularities.  

Walis is the result of a 24h hackathon hosted by IBM and partners in Hamburg around the topic IBM Watson & healthcare.
